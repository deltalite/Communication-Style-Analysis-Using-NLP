Next, we'll want the 5 best selling albums and artists without \"Greatest\" in the album title (since azlyrics doesn't have those albums and it's a good site to scrape). Possible alternatives like Lyrics.com are harder to navigate en masse (page urls can't be guessed since they have long numbers) and they don't have straightforward album-song navigation."

I'll be using the fact that names are (usually) two words and that we would be redirected to the main page if the url isn't found to bypass this problem. Artists with three names (so far as I've seen) have URLs like groups. There's also some inconsistency with the two word names since Billy Joel is at `/b/billyjoel.html` and Michael Jackson is at `/j/jackson.html`. I thought maybe since the Jackson 5 was linked on the same page that this was the reason for a different pattern, but David bowie is also at `/b/bowie.html`. I won't agonize it too much, I will just see if I can get success on one of the possible pages.\n",
