    "As a review from the last notebook, we scraped speech transcripts from James Clear's website on his [\"Great Speeches\" page](https://jamesclear.com/great-speeches) (where we took the top 10 which are sorted alphabetically by the orator's last name) and the lyrics from all songs in bestselling albums of all time (according to this [Business Insider article](https://www.businessinsider.com/50-best-selling-albums-all-time-2016-9)) from [AZLyrics](https://www.azlyrics.com/). \n",

    "Below are what our raw dataframes look like. Not bad if I do say so myself. Of course, there's a lot of preprocessing that has to be done, but it looks like we properly collected the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edit: Temporarily, I will be using `speeches_raw.xlsx` and  `songs_raw.xlsx` dataset which are datasets generated taking the top 24 speeches and songs successfully scraped from the websites. I'm doing this so that I have a larger dataset to work with for the analysis notebook, which will make it more helpful when visualized and easier to describe what the data in general looks like. I later plan to debug scraping errors that started to appear when generating over 10 rows due to differences in URLs and page structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "My data where I only scraped the first 10 links for songs and speeches is in the `data_n=10` folder. This is mostly just to save the data somewhere where it won't be overwritten as I work with my longer dataframes."

    "Stemming and lemmatization are important for NLP when looking at word count, topics and other applications that don't care about the right usage of verbs or complete words. This means these techniques should not be used if you are trying text synthesis, question answering or sentiment analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stemmers use an algorithm to get the stem/root of given words. This way, if you have variations on a word like \"walk\" such as \"walked\" and \"walking\", they would all be stemmed to \"walk\" and we'd have an appropriate count of the use of the verb in our corpus. The SnowballStemmer is preferred for achieving the best practical results, but if you're curious about the different popular types and how they differ, it is explained in more detail below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lemmatizers work to achieve the same goal as stemmers, except the approach is different. When talking about lemmas for NLP, we are talking about a word with a similar meaning to the word being lemmatized. Of course, this is to keep words consistent - a lemma doesn't always need to be different from the input word. For example, \"create\", \"making\" and \"make\" lemmatized could all be \"make\". Now this might not be true for the lemmatizer we'll use, but this gives you an idea on how it could get rid of noise from synonyms. We'll take a more detailed look at how lemmatizers work in practice below.\n",

Much of the code in the block above is standard for calculating tf-idf since the TfidfVectorizer was built to be used in a certain way. The index, i selects which row we want to base the tf-idf values since tf is a document-specific metric (expand on this later). Consequently, when we look at the first row, we see many words relating to Nigeria and stories since Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is a Nigerian writer, telling her story (which involves reading stories). From there you understand why those words have the highest tf-idf weights. \n",
