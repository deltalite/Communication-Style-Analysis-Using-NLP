    "So what did I mean when saying I'd explore the differences between speeches and songs? That's a good question, especially since each corpus was authored by a different group. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll start off with some simple features of the corpora such as vocabulary, length, word frequency (in-document) and any more that come to mind as I progress. Following that, we'll dive into sentiment analysis and topic modeling, see if songs are more subjective than speeches or if \"great speeches\" are often positive. Remember this is a learning project, the data being explored may be a bit silly but through it we can learn different NLP techniques and see the problems associated with real life data."
