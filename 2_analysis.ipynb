    "So what did I mean when saying I'd explore the differences between speeches and songs? That's a good question, especially since each corpus was authored by a different group. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll start off with some simple features of the corpora such as vocabulary, length, word frequency (in-document) and any more that come to mind as I progress. Following that, we'll dive into sentiment analysis and topic modeling, see if songs are more subjective than speeches or if \"great speeches\" are often positive. Remember this is a learning project, the data being explored may be a bit silly but through it we can learn different NLP techniques and see the problems associated with real life data."

TextBlob tends to work better on proper writing, but of course since they have different implementations, I'd expect that this is not always the case. Here are the links to [VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) and [TextBlob](https://github.com/sloria/TextBlob)'s respective Githubs. VADER's README file includes [how its scoring works](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment#about-the-scoring).\n",

    "I'm sure you're aware, but I want to point out that my corpora are quite long. How will that affect our analyzers and is there anything we can do to improve it? We'll test out a couple methods of approach and see which one seems most accurate. I'm not worried about the speeches (they're all well written/formatted) but songs are a different story. They sometimes have periods but many do not and that's understandable, songs aren't usually made of complete sentences."

    "\n",
    "### LDA - About:\n",
    "A statistical model (algorithm) used to determine which words fit best under which topics. As mentioned, you say how many topics and then words start (randomly at first) being assigned to the different groups. From there, it's an iterative process of going through the words and deciding if the word should be put under a different topic. How does it do this? Well, you start looking at the probability of topic given the corpus and the probability of a word given the topic. The product of these is essenentially our model's probability the word belongs to the topic. For a more in depth explanation (and to cite my sources in an informal way) take a look at [Edwin Chen's intro to LDA page](http://blog.echen.me/2011/08/22/introduction-to-latent-dirichlet-allocation/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### NMF - About: \n",
    "A group of algorithms used to (approximately) factorize a non-negative matrix (all entries $\\ge 0$) into 2 matrices that are also non-negative. We use algorithms to approximate the factorization because there isn't always an analytical solution. According to this [Medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/topic-modeling-articles-with-nmf-8c6b2a227a45#2ba8) (I know, don't trust everything you read on the internet), the left factorized matrix holds the topics while the right one hold the weights of those topics. Of course, we'll be using the bag of words version of our data as our initial matrix, so our \"topics\" will actually be words. Unlike LDA, we'll be using TF-IDF applied to our BoW model since that is a way to measure how important words are to the specific article (recall TF is document specific). \n",

She went substantially further in detail into how the algorithms work and goes over a complete example of topic modelling using an sklearn dataset, so check it out if you're interested. "

    "Alright, so since we've decided to use LDA, we have to figure out which library we want to use (I am not ambitious enough to build my own, at least not when there isn't a practical reason to do so). Scikit-learn and gensim both have LDA models, but I will be using sklearn because it's faster. It's hard to objectively compare as attempted in the below articles, so why not use the faster one if there isn't a clear winner?\n",

    "The following code block, we use CountVectorizer to get the count (or term frequency, aka tf) of each word in each document (corpus). If you take a look at sklearn's [documentation for CountVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html), you'll notice I'm not using many of the optional parameters. This is because we've already dealt with stopwords, we aren't dealing with n-grams (we're not looking at groups of n contiguous words) and I'm not sure if the length of our documents will prove a problem for the algorithms. Many of the parameters like min_df are to denoise/ignore words that don't meet whatever threshold the parameter concerns itself with. I'll test them out and perhaps add some comments on that after the fact. "
