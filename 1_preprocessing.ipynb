    "Stemming and lemmatization are important for NLP when looking at word count, topics and other applications that don't care about the right usage of verbs or complete words. This means these techniques should not be used if you are trying text synthesis, question answering or sentiment analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stemmers use an algorithm to get the stem/root of given words. This way, if you have variations on a word like \"walk\" such as \"walked\" and \"walking\", they would all be stemmed to \"walk\" and we'd have an appropriate count of the use of the verb in our corpus. The SnowballStemmer is preferred for achieving the best practical results, but if you're curious about the different popular types and how they differ, it is explained in more detail below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lemmatizers work to achieve the same goal as stemmers, except the approach is different. When talking about lemmas for NLP, we are talking about a word with a similar meaning to the word being lemmatized. Of course, this is to keep words consistent - a lemma doesn't always need to be different from the input word. For example, \"create\", \"making\" and \"make\" lemmatized could all be \"make\". Now this might not be true for the lemmatizer we'll use, but this gives you an idea on how it could get rid of noise from synonyms. We'll take a more detailed look at how lemmatizers work in practice below."
