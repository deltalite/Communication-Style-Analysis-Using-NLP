# Analysis of Different Types of Communication
In this project, we will explore the fundamental differences between the language used in:
* Poems
* Speeches
* Songs
* Rap

This analysis will use packages like nltk and pandas.

## Sample Selection
For poems, speeches and rap, a list of about 5 from each category will be collected based on general popularity. 
Popularity itself is difficult to quantify, so I will select those with substantial text that are found in multiple
"Best" <medium> lists online.

Song selection methodology is more challenging because there are so many genres. Methodology for sample selection
is very important to ensure selection processes aren't bias, but this is a for fun project, so I will select songs
that aren't too repetitive, that I know to be popular and might resemble the other (slightly more standard) categories.

Please do not ignore selection methodology (as seen here) if doing a project where the results matter.

## Data Collection
Web scraping will be conducted using Selenium and Beautiful Soup (if appropriate).
