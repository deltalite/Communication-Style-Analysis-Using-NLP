# Analysis of Different Types of Communication
In this project, we will explore the fundamental differences between the language used in:
* Speeches
* Songs

This analysis will use packages like nltk and pandas.

## Sample Selection
Five speeches and five albums worth of song lyrics will be analyzed.
Popularity itself is difficult to quantify, so I based the choice of albums based on most sold and speeches based on what was available.

Methodology for sample selection is very important to ensure selection processes aren't bias, 
but this is a for fun project, so I think it is alright to pick speeches based on what is on
James Clear's website, selected in alphabetical order.

Please do not ignore selection methodology (as seen here) if doing a project where the results matter.

## Data Collection
Web scraping will be conducted using both Selenium and Beautiful Soup.
